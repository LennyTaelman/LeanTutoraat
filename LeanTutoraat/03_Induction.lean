/- # Induction -/

/- ## Proving something holds for all natural numbres with `simple_induction` -/

/-
  Say we want to prove something for all `n : ℕ` by induction.

  The tactic `simple_induction n with k IH` creates two goals:
  - a base case: prove the statement for `n = 0`
  - an inductive step: prove the statement for `n = k + 1`,
    where the induction hypothesis `IH` is that the statement holds for `n = k`
  We then need to provide proofs for the base case and the inductive step.
-/

/-
  Below is a simple example. Note the two dots `·` after `simple_induction`.
  These indicate the two goals: base case and inductive step. Put your cursor
  after these dots to see the goals.

  Note that after the second dot, the induction hypothesis `IH` appears as a
  new hypothesis that is now available in the proof.

  Replace all the `sorry`s with proofs. Each one can be handled by a single tactic.

example (n : ℕ) : 2 ^ n ≥ n + 1 := by
  simple_induction n with k IH
  · sorry
  · calc
      2 ^ (k + 1) = 2 * 2 ^ k           := by sorry
                _ ≥ 2 * (k + 1)         := by sorry -- use the induction hypothesis `IH`
                _ ≥ (k + 1) + 1         := by sorry


/-
  Now fill in the proofs of base and inductive step in the following proof.

/-
  Finally, write an induction proof for the following statement.

  To typeset the dots for base and inductive case, use `\.` Note that the proofs
  for base and inductive step are indented.

  Tip: first write a skeleton induction proof, with `sorry` for the base and inductive steps.

/- ## Prove something holds for all `n ≥ C` with `induction_from_starting_point` -/

/-
  Sometimes we want to prove something for all n ≥ C,
  and hence want to start induction at n = C.

  If `n` is a natural number and `hn` the hypothesis that `C ≤ n`,
  then the tactic `induction_from_starting_point n, hn with k hk IH`
  creates two goals:
  - a base case: prove the statement for `n = C`
  - an inductive step: prove the statement for `n = k + 1`, where
    * `hk` is the assumption that `k ≥ C`
    * `IH` is the induction hypothesis (the statement holds for `n = k`)

  Place your cursor after the two dots to see the goals. Then replace the
  sorry's with proofs.
-/

example (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 2) : n ^ 2 ≥ n + 2 := by
  induction_from_starting_point n, hn with k hk IH
  · sorry
  · calc
      (k + 1) ^ 2  = k ^ 2 + 2 * k + 1   := by sorry
                 _ ≥ (k + 2) + 2 * k + 1 := by sorry
                 _ ≥ (k + 1) + 2         := by sorry

/-
  Now do the following one yourself

  One more variation. In this one, we show that `n ^ 2 ≥ n + 100` holds for if
  `n` is sufficiently large. We state it as `∃ C : ℕ, n ≥ C → n ^ 2 ≥ n + 100`,
  where the arrow `→` should be read as an implication.

  Prove this in lean, by following these steps:
  1. Figure out what value of `C` you will use. (For the sake of argument, let's
     say you want to use `C = 5`)
  2. Start the proof with `use 5`. The goal is now `n ≥ 5 → n ^ 2 ≥ n + 100`
  3. Use the tactic `intro h` to introduce the hypothesis `n ≥ 5`. The goal will
     now be `n ^ 2 ≥ n + 100`.
  4. Finish the proof using induction.

/- # Finite sums -/

/-
  Induction is a powerful tool for proving statements about finite sums of the
  form `Σ_{i=0}^{n} a_i`.

  As a first example, let us prove that for every `n : ℕ` we have
    `1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2 ^ (n - 1) = 2 ^ n - 1`

  First we define the left-hand side as a function
  `s : ℕ → ℕ` which maps `n` to `1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2 ^ (n - 1)`.
-/

def s (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 0
  | n + 1 => s n + 2 ^ n

/-
  The above defines `s 0` to be `0` (the empty sum) and `s (n + 1)` to be
  `s n + 2 ^ n`. So for small values of `n` we find:
  - `s 0 = 0`
  - `s 1 = s 0 + 2 ^ 0 = 0 + 1`
  - `s 2 = s 1 + 2 ^ 1 = 0 + 1 + 2`
  - `s 3 = s 2 + 2 ^ 2 = 0 + 1 + 2 + 4`
  as expected.

  In proving things about `s` you will need to *use* the lemmas `s_zero` and
  `s_succ` below. For example, you can use `rewrite [s_zero]` to transform `s 0` into `0`.
-/

lemma s_zero : s 0 = 0 := by rfl

lemma s_succ (n : ℕ) : s (n + 1) = s n + 2 ^ n := by rfl

/-
  As a warming-up, and sanity check, let's verify that `s 1 = 1` and `s 2 = 3`.
-/

example : s 1 = 1 := by
  rewrite [s_succ]
  rewrite [s_zero]
  numbers

-- do this one yourself
example : s 2 = 3 := by
  sorry


/-
  You can now prove that `s n = 2 ^ n - 1` for all `n : ℕ`. We state it slightly
  differently, as `1 + s n = 2 ^ n`, to avoid having to deal with subtraction in
  `ℕ`.

  Replace both `sorry`s with proofs.

  The code below defines s1 : ℕ → ℕ recursively. We have
  s1 n = 1 + 2 + ... + n
-/

def s1 (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 0
  | n + 1 => (s1 n) + (n + 1)

/-
  Again you can ignore the definition above, you'll only use the following lemmas, which
  completely determine `s1 n` for all `n : ℕ`.
-/

lemma s1_zero : s1 0 = 0 := by rfl

lemma s1_succ (n : ℕ) : s1 (n + 1) = s1 n + (n + 1) := by rfl

/-
  Sanity check: should have s1 3 = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Prove this.
-/

example : s1 3 = 6 := by
  sorry


/-
  We now prove that `s1 n = n * (n + 1) / 2`. We state it as
  `2 * s1 n = n * (n + 1)` to avoid having to deal with division in `ℕ`
  (in particular, it is not a priori clear that the right hand side is a natural
  number!).

  Let's move to squares! Consider s2 n = 1 + 2 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 2 + ... + n ^ 2.
-/

def s2 (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  match n with
  | 0 => 0
  | n + 1 => (s2 n) + (n + 1) ^ 2

lemma s2_zero : s2 0 = 0 := by rfl

lemma s2_succ (n : ℕ) : s2 (n + 1) = s2 n + (n + 1) ^ 2 := by rfl

/-
  Sanity checks are good!

example : s2 2 = 5 := by

/-
  Write a proof that `6 * s2 n = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)`.

  Congratulations! You now know how to write induction proofs in Lean. If you
  want one more challenge, try to prove Bernoulli's inequality:
    `(1 + x) ^ n ≥ 1 + n * x` for all `x ≥ 0` and `n ≥ 0`
  by induction on `n`.

  At some point, you may see expressions like `↑k * x` in the right window pane.
  This up-arrow indicates that the natural number `k` is being considered as a
  real number before being multiplied with `x`. Lean is terribly careful and
  pedantic about such things (and must be). Next week we'll learn some
  techniques to deal with such things. For the proof below, you should not
  worry, since `algebra` will automatically take care of this where needed.

  Final hint: the tactic `simp` will automaticall simplify expressions like `0 *
  x` or `x ^ 0` or `x + 0`. You may find this useful in the base case of the induction.
