# Lean Tutoraat

This repository contains the Lean code for a short introduction to Lean taught
by [Lenny Taelman](https://lennytaelman.github.io/) to 2nd year undergraduates
at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/).

This is work in progress.

It uses (a version of) the dialect of Lean developed for the book
[The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001) by
[Heather Macbeth](https://faculty.fordham.edu/hmacbeth1), with permission from
the author.
